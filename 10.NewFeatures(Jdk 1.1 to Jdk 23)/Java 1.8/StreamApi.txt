Stream API:-
            In Java 8. Stream is a collection of Objects that are pipelined to process &
             to get desired Output
            Stream API contains various Methods to perform operation on collection of objects
            For example,filtering,Mapping,reducing,sorting,...etc
            By using stream api, we can reduce the code.
    java.util.stream.Stream<T>
    methods:-
        Public abstract Stream<T> filter(Predicate<T>);
        Public abstract Stream<R> map(function<T,R>);
        Public abstract Stream<T> distinct();
        Public abstract Stream<T> sorted();
        Public abstract void foreach(Consumer <T>);
        public abstract T reduce(T,BinaryOperator<T>);
Fliter() Method:-
    It is used to filter the elements of a collection based on predicate logic
java.util.Collection<E>
Method:-
    Public default Stream<E> stream()
    It returns Stream reference
ForEach() Method:-
    It used to iterate elements of a collection based  on Consmer logic
Map():-
    It is used to Map every element of a collection to perform operation by using function logic
Distinct() Method:-
    It is used to get unique elements form collection
Sorted() Method:-
    It used to sort the elements of a collection
Reduce() Method:-
    It is used to perform operations on collection elements to
     get a single value based on Binary operator logic
