Network Programming:-

            Network:
            A set of co-operative interconnected computers.
            Co-operation is possible with network software and interconnection is possible with network hardware.

            Internet:- Network of Network is called as an internet
            Client:- A client is a software the sends request to a server to  get the response

            server:-A server is a software that receives request from the client,process the request,constructs 
                    the response back to the client
            Socket:- It is a connection end at client side.

            ServerSocket:- It is a connection end at server side.

            Port Number:- It is used to identify the service. Port numbers range is 0 to 65535.
            Reserved port numbers are 0 to 1023 and free port numbers are 1024 to 65535.

All the network class are present in the java.net.*; package
    Steps to develop client application:

    1) Create a Socket object with server address and port number.
    2) Create an OutputStream that can be used to send information to the server.
    3) Create an InputStream that can be used to receive information from the server.
    4) Do Input/Output Operations.
    5) Close the Socket

    Steps to develop server application:

    1) Create a ServerSocket object with port number.
    2) Call accept() method to receive requests from the client.
    3) Create an InputStream that can be used to receive information from the client.
    4) Create an OutputStream that can be used to send information to the client.
    5) Do Input/Output operations.
    6) Close the ServerSocket.
